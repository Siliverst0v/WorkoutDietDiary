Workout and Diet Diary App

Built on the SwiftUI framework, data storage and deletion is implemented via RealmSwift.

The first part of the application allows you to create a workout by selecting muscle groups and exercises for them:

    * When you click on a group, it is highlighted on the human model
    
    * The exercise is opened by clicking on it and you can immediately fill in the fields
    
    * The "memories" button on the right allows you to see the results of this exercise in past workouts,
    you do not need to remember and search.

    * You can also leave a note on the exercise

When the workout is created, it will appear on the main screen.

    * If needed, it can be removed.
    
    * When pressed, we go to the detailed view and see all the selected exercises, 
    they can be edited and deleted. You can also add exercises from this screen.
